      description:
        "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.",

        "To get the most out of modern JavaScript, you need learn the latest features of its parent specification, ECMAScript 6 (ES6). This book provides a highly practical look at ES6, without getting lost in the specification or its implementation details. Armed with practical examples, author Nicolas Bevacqua shows you new ways to deal with asynchronous flow control, declare objects or functions, and create proxies or unique sets, among many other features. The first title in Bevacqua’s Modular JavaScript series, Practical Modern JavaScript prepares JavaScript and Node.js developers for applied lessons in modular design, testing, and deployment in subsequent books. This book explains: How JavaScript and its standards development process have evolved Essential ES6 changes, including arrow functions, destructuring, let and const Class syntax for declaring object prototypes, and the new Symbol primitive How to handle flow control with Promises, iterators, generators, and async functions ES6 collection built-in types for creating object maps and unique sets How and when to use the new Proxy and Reflect built-ins Changes to Array, Math, numbers, strings, Unicode, and regular expressions, and other improvements since ES5",

This durable and attractive hardcover edition is a book you will have open on your desk as a reference for years to come. A timeless and lasting version of a classic "Duckett" book in a hardbound, dust-jacketed edition Completely accessible to those who feel intimidated by the subject matter and relevant to all front-end designers and developers who need to understand JavaScript Discusses applying responsive design techniques, leveraging APIs to save you time and work in coding, and identifying when to use CSS transforms over pure JavaScript Beautiful 4-color illustrations and examples make this a terrific academic resource for those of all experience levels JavaScript & jQuery clearly explains the jargon of programming, addressing the vocabulary without making it a prerequisite for readers. Duckett speaks directly to readers, making this an invaluable resource.

        "“It’s uncommon to have a programming language wonk who can speak in such comfortable and friendly language as David does. His walk through the syntax and semantics of JavaScript is both charming and hugely insightful; reminders of gotchas complement realistic use cases, paced at a comfortable curve. You’ll find when you finish the book that you’ve gained a strong and comprehensive sense of mastery.” —Paul Irish, developer advocate, Google Chrome “This is not a book for those looking for shortcuts; rather it is hard-won experience distilled into a guided tour. It’s one of the few books on JS that I’ll recommend without hesitation.” —Alex Russell, TC39 member, software engineer, Google In order to truly master JavaScript, you need to learn how to work effectively with the language’s flexible, expressive features and how to avoid its pitfalls. No matter how long you’ve been writing JavaScript code, Effective JavaScript will help deepen your understanding of this powerful language, so you can build more predictable, reliable, and maintainable programs. Author David Herman, with his years of experience on Ecma’s JavaScript standardization committee, illuminates the language’s inner workings as never before—helping you take full advantage of JavaScript’s expressiveness. Reflecting the latest versions of the JavaScript standard, the book offers well-proven techniques and best practices you’ll rely on for years to come. Effective JavaScript is organized around 68 proven approaches for writing better JavaScript, backed by concrete examples. You’ll learn how to choose the right programming style for each project, manage unanticipated problems, and work more successfully with every facet of JavaScript programming from data structures to concurrency. Key features include Better ways to use prototype-based object-oriented programming Subtleties and solutions for working with arrays and dictionary objects Precise and practical explanations of JavaScript’s functions and variable scoping semantics Useful JavaScript programming patterns and idioms, such as options objects and method chaining In-depth guidance on using JavaScript’s unique “run-to-completion” approach to concurrency",

Key FeaturesExplore the new ES6 syntax, the event loop, and asynchronous programmingLearn the test-driven development approach when building appsMaster advanced JavaScript concepts to enhance your web developments skillBook Description If you are looking for a programming language to develop flexible and efficient applications, JavaScript is an obvious choice. Advanced JavaScript is a hands-on guide that takes you through JavaScript and its many features, one step at a time. You'll begin by learning how to use the new JavaScript syntax in ES6, and then work through the many other features that modern JavaScript has to offer. As you progress through the chapters, you’ll use asynchronous programming with callbacks and promises, handle browser events, and perform Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation. You'll also explore various methods of testing JavaScript projects. In the concluding chapters, you'll discover functional programming and learn to use it to build your apps. With this book as your guide, you'll also be able to develop APIs using Node.js and Express, create front-ends using React/Redux, and build mobile apps using React/Expo. By the end of Advanced JavaScript, you will have explored the features and benefits of JavaScript to build small applications. What you will learnExamine major features in ES6 and implement those features to build applicationsCreate promise and callback handlers to work with asynchronous processesDevelop asynchronous flows using Promise chaining and async/await syntaxManipulate the DOM with JavaScriptHandle JavaScript browser eventsExplore Test Driven Development and build code tests with JavaScript code testing frameworks.List the benefits and drawbacks of functional programming compared to other stylesConstruct applications with the Node.js backend framework and the React frontend frameworkWho this book is for This book is designed to target anyone who wants to write JavaScript in a professional environment. We expect the audience to have used JavaScript in some capacity and be familiar with the basic syntax. This book would be good for a tech enthusiast wondering when to use generators or how to use Promises and Callbacks effectively, or a novice developer who wants to deepen their knowledge on JavaScript and understand TDD.",
